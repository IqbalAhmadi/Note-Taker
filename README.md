- APIs : With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

- Performance : Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.

**2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** :

- Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

- A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.

- Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.
